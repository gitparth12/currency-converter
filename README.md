Hello! Thank you for using our currency converter!

Our app's user interface is simply a command-line interface. To run the code please write "gradle run" in the command line. To run the code as an admin, the password is "SOFT2412" ;)

To TEST the code please either run "gradle build" on the command line and follow the link to the tests it gives you, or use our handy Jenkins project. Our completed project and its tests are in this link: http://108.61.185.239/job/SOFT_assignment1/
